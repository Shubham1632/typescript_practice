## Interfaces
- almost like structure in the c++
- can implement the objects of interface 

## Classes
 - combination of attributes and behaviour
 - can use objects of one class as an attribute to another class
 
 
 ## Generics 
 - use to make classes independent from type
 - can use with various types of variables to use with same methodology
 
 ## Extras 
 - can use two interfaces segregated 
 
 ```
 interface A { }
 interface B { }
 
 type obj = new A () | new B ()
 ```
 - or we can use the & here
